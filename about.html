  <b> <i><h4> We are one of the world’s most influential dance education and training organisations. With our global headquarters in London, our work takes us into diverse communities, locally and around the world, to widen access to dance and to share the benefits and wellbeing that it brings.

        While we maintain close ties to ballet with our internationally-taught RAD Syllabus, our outreach programmes provide opportunities for dance to secondary school pupils across the London area, classes for children with special educational needs and disabilities, and for older dancers to keep active with our popular Silver Swans classes. Our newly-opened global headquarters in London will allow us to welcome more people into our home for dance and for us to to strengthen our connection with our community.
        
        We empower people through dance education and enjoyment, and believe that ‘every body’ should have the opportunity to learn to dance.</h4> </i></b>
